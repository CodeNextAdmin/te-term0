//Day 1 Challenges

// Example
let message = "Hello World!";
console.log(message);

/* -------------------------------------------- */

// Challenge 1:
// Imagine it's the first day of class. (Wait, it is the first day isn't it..Deja vu?) 
// Everyone's participating in an icebreaker and has to introduce themselves. 
// It goes something like:

console.log("Hi! My name is ${name}");
console.log("I'm in the " + grade + "th grade.");
console.log("A fun fact about me is that " + funFact);

// Declare and initalize the variables with your response! 
// Hint: Also think about where you would declare and initialize those variables

// **** Upchallenge ****
// Can you also print out the data type of the variables? 

/* -------------------------------------------- */

// Challenge 2: 
// Below is a set of problems to help you solidify your understanding of math operators
// Write your solution code under each commented problem. 

// Here are some variables to get you started
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;

// **** Problem 1 ****
// Store the sum of num1 and num2 in a variable.
// Print the sum.


// **** Problem 2 ****
// Store the difference between sum (above) and 7 in a variable.
// Print the difference.


// **** Problem 3 ****
// Store the product of the difference and 3 in a variable.
// Print the product.


// **** Problem 4 ****
// Store the power of the product squared in a variable.
// Print the power.


// **** Problem 5 ****
// Store the quotient of the power divided by 4 in a variable.
// Print the quotient.


// **** Problem 6 ****
// Store the remainder of the quotient divided by 2 in a variable.
// Print the remainder.


// **** Upchallenge! ****
// Given a variable that stores a number, print the values that come right before and right after.
// For example, given the number 4, the program should print 3 and 5. 
// Your code should work if the value of the variable is changed.

let num = 9;
